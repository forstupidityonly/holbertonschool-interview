# **Holberton School Interview**

This repository contains algorithm assignments designed to prepare students for the interview process

## *0x00-lockboxes*

You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

## *0x01-insert_in_sorted_linked_list*

Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

## *0x02-heap_insert*

Write a function that creates a binary tree node:
Write a function that inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap:

## *0x03-minimum_operations*

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

## *0x04-sandpiles*

Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

## *0x05-linked_list_palindrome*

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

## *0x06-log_parsing*

Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:

## *0x07-linked_list_cycle*

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it

## *0x08-palindrome_integer*

Write a function that checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome.

## *0x09-utf8_validation*

Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## *0x0B-menger*

Write a function that draws a 2D Menger Sponge

## *0x0C-nqueens*

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

## *0x0D-sorted_array_to_avl*

Write a function that builds an AVL tree from an array

## *0x0E-linear_skip*

Looking for a specific value in a singly linked list always leads to browse every element of the list. A common way to optimize the time complexity of a search in a singly li    nked list is to modify the list itself by adding an “express lane” to browse it. A linked list with an express lane is called a skip list.

## *0x0F-starwars_api*

Write a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie:

## *0x10-rain*

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

## *0x11-heap_sort*

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

## *0x12-advanced_binary_search*

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers.

## *0x14-heap_extract*

Write a function that extracts the root node of a Max Binary Heap:

## *0x15-infinite_multiplication*

Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers:

## *0x16-rotate_2d_matrix*

Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

## *0x17-find_the_loop*

Write a function that finds the loop in a linked list.

## *0x18-merge_sort*

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm:
